# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Developer Learning Tool

## Introduction/Overview

The AI-Powered Developer Learning Tool is a Duolingo-inspired web application designed to help beginning developers learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through interactive, gamified learning experiences. The tool addresses the common challenges faced by new developers: finding structured learning paths, receiving personalized feedback, and maintaining motivation through an engaging, interactive interface.

The application leverages OpenAI's API to provide intelligent code feedback and explanations, creating a personalized learning experience that adapts to each user's progress and learning style.

## Goals

1. **Create an engaging learning experience** that motivates users to practice coding daily through gamification elements
2. **Provide structured learning paths** for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can be taken independently or together
3. **Deliver personalized feedback** using AI to help users understand their mistakes and improve their coding skills
4. **Build a scalable platform** that can easily expand to include additional programming languages and concepts
5. **Achieve high user retention** through streaks, daily goals, and progress tracking

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
- **As a complete beginner**, I want to start with basic HTML concepts so that I can build my first web page
- **As a beginner with some experience**, I want to practice JavaScript fundamentals so that I can add interactivity to my websites
- **As a mixed-level learner**, I want to choose my own learning path so that I can focus on areas where I need improvement
- **As a daily learner**, I want to maintain my streak and earn XP so that I stay motivated to practice regularly
- **As a code writer**, I want to receive AI feedback on my code so that I can understand my mistakes and learn best practices

### Secondary User Stories
- **As a user**, I want to track my progress across different topics so that I can see my improvement over time
- **As a learner**, I want quick 5-10 minute sessions so that I can fit learning into my busy schedule
- **As a student**, I want to see explanations for why my code is correct or incorrect so that I can learn from my mistakes

## Functional Requirements

### Core Learning Features

7. The system must award XP points for completed exercises and questions
8. The system must set and track daily learning goals
9. The system must display user progress and statistics
10. The system must provide visual feedback for correct and incorrect answers

### User Experience Features

14. The system must have an intuitive, mobile-responsive interface
15. The system must provide immediate feedback on user actions

### Technical Features
16. The system must securely handle OpenAI API keys and user data
17. The system must work offline for basic functionality (cached questions)
18. The system must be built with React and TypeScript for maintainability
19. The system must include proper error handling and loading states
20. The system must be deployable as a single-page application

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Advanced programming concepts** beyond basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Real-time collaboration** or social features
- **Video content** or multimedia lessons
- **Certification or credentialing** system
- **Payment processing** or subscription management
- **Multi-language support** for the interface
- **Advanced AI features** like code generation or complex tutoring

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Duolingo-inspired design** with clean, colorful interface
- **Mobile-first responsive design** for accessibility across devices
- **Progress indicators** showing completion status for each track
- **Achievement badges** and visual rewards for motivation
- **Intuitive navigation** between different learning tracks
- **Accessible design** following WCAG guidelines

### Visual Design Elements
- **Color-coded tracks** (e.g., HTML in orange, CSS in blue, JavaScript in yellow)
- **Progress bars** and completion percentages
- **Streak counters** prominently displayed
- **XP point displays** with animations for earned points
- **Clean typography** optimized for code readability

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- **React with TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability
- **Component-based architecture** for reusability
- **State management** using React Context or Redux for user progress
- **Local storage** for offline progress tracking
- **RESTful API integration** with OpenAI

### Dependencies
- **OpenAI API** for intelligent feedback and explanations
- **React Router** for navigation between tracks
- **CSS-in-JS or styled-components** for component styling
- **Axios or Fetch** for API communications
- **React Testing Library** for component testing

### Security
- **Environment variables** for API key management
- **Input validation** for all user submissions
- **Rate limiting** for API calls to prevent abuse
- **Secure storage** of user progress and preferences

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- **Daily Active Users (DAU)** - Target: 70% of registered users
- **Session duration** - Target: Average 8-12 minutes per session
- **Streak retention** - Target: 40% of users maintain 7+ day streaks

### Learning Effectiveness
- **Completion rates** - Target: 60% completion rate for each track
- **Progress velocity** - Target: Users advance 1 level per week on average
- **Return rate** - Target: 80% of users return within 48 hours

### Technical Performance
- **Page load time** - Target: < 3 seconds initial load
- **API response time** - Target: < 2 seconds for AI feedback
- **Error rate** - Target: < 1% of user interactions result in errors

## Open Questions

1. **Content Creation**: How will we initially populate the question bank? Should we start with a curated set or generate questions using AI?
2. **Difficulty Progression**: How should we determine when a user is ready to advance to the next level?
3. **Offline Functionality**: What level of offline support is needed for users with poor internet connectivity?
4. **Data Privacy**: What user data should we collect and how should we handle GDPR compliance?
5. **Monetization**: Are there plans for premium features or is this intended to remain free?
6. **Content Updates**: How frequently should we update or add new questions and exercises?
7. **Accessibility**: What specific accessibility features are most important for our target users?
