### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npm test` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- Environment variables should be prefixed with `REACT_APP_` to be accessible in the React app.
